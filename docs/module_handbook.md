MCOMD3PFL Programming Frameworks and Languages - Handbook
=========================================================

Date and validity September 2023, Academic year 2023–2024

## Study hours for the module
* Total 200 hours
* Number of contact hour and pattern of delivery: 50 hours 
* Number of hours when students are expected to study independently or amongst peers, with no direct academic contact: 150 hours of Practice learning and independent study

## Module aims
To develop the student’s understanding of the fundamental concepts of Programming Frameworks and Languages. This module supports the Implement and Operate elements of the CDIO model.

## Module learning outcomes
By the end of the module students should be able to:

1. Demonstrate an understanding of the concept of a Framework in general, a Framework used for Programming, and a Framework used for software Testing
2. Critically evaluate the effectiveness of a particular framework for an application and platform
3. Synthesise a small digital artefact using a well-formed programming framework

## Overview of learning and teaching activities on the module
* This module will use the CDIO educational framework within the context of developing a full-stack web service to a formal business specification using professional software engineering tools. 
* Making use of active learning tools such as project work and self directed problem-based learning, thus equipping computing students with improved technical knowledge of using an engineering tool-chain. 
* The module will be taught using a combination of lectures, computer laboratory based practical workshops and computer laboratory-based seminars.
* Lectures will be used to cover the background theoretical aspects of the module and will, whenever appropriate, make explicit the relationships between theory and practice; and will use practical demonstrations to reinforce fundamental concepts.
* Students will be involved in regular discussions that focus on dissecting and justifying the use of a range of software tooling.
* Students will be expected to self-managed their learning and self select tools to implement a working solution that meets a predefined specification.
* In addition, time will be spent exploring a range of web frameworks. Each framework was created to solve a specific problem.
* Supervised support sessions will provide guidance on the progress of individual projects, commend good work and to identify areas that need improvement.
* Ongoing feedback will be provided throughout the module by a range of automated tests.
* Blackboard and GitHub will be the repository’s for all learning materials.

## Equipment you need to bring to class
* We will be using linux containers to develop and test software
* A Cloud Based IDEs (GitPod/GitHubCodeSpaces) will be used to support your work both on and off campus
    * Cloud based development environments are becoming common practice for industry development. 
* Some students may wish to setup their own equipment for native development environment (e.g. DockerDesktop)


## Assessments

* You will be working in own public GitHub forked repository of https://github.com/calaldees/frameworks_and_languages_module
* At the datetime of the deadline a snapshot of your fork will automatically be taken from GitHub. 
* In addition, You need to formally submit a zip file with the contents of your repository to TurnitIn for a formal audit trail.

### Academic Misconduct

* The objective is NOT to submit work that meets the assessment criteria.
* The objective is to meet the leaning objectives of the module.

Submissions to any submission may be subject to the academic misconduct process.
"Student understanding" is the objective of the course/module.
The digital artifact and written report on their own are are poor proxies for student understanding.
It is expected that students have continually demonstrated their understanding throughout the formative assessment process of this modules delivery.

All students should be able to demo their solution, describe aspects of it’s functionality, show their workflow or engage in discussion about framework/language features.
All students will be given the opportunity to verbally express their understanding of their submissions.
This will be evidenced by formative assessment and engagement with sessions throughout the module delivery.
If students have been unable to demonstrate understanding of their work incrementally in sessions, they may be asked to demo their submissions to academic staff after submission.

Examples:
* If a student commits multiple times a week (20+ commits over the module). Each commit message has an accurate technical description of what was added/attempted/changed. The student can demonstrate in sessions, an understanding of their functionality to a tutor or peer. It is evident that the student understands the module leaning outcomes.
* If a student submits a repository, with 2 or 3 commits with the title `added stuff`, a few days before the assignment deadline. It is likely that the submission will be reported for the Academic Misconduct process.

#### Citing sources of information

It is expected that students openly share and discuss code; these are traits/skills of a professional developers. 
Some sharing of solutions is acceptable and normal, but are almost always supported by referencing the developer conversion. Please refer to individual assignment descriptions for examples.


## Indicative schedule of delivery
The course will consist of 44 hours of workshops with direct tuition and an additional 44 hours of supervised support. 
Totalling of 88 hours of tutor support.
The module will be broken into 11 workshops with 4 hours tuition and an additional 4 hours supervised support. It is expected (but not compulsory) that students use the additional supervised support time to apply the concepts conveys in the morning workshops.

## Guidance on how to use independent study time
* You are expected to self-select the languages and frameworks for your assessment implementation.
* At Level 6; The use of the frameworks are your responsibility. You will not be directly instructed how to use one particular framework.
* It is expected that you follow the online tutorials for a range of frameworks to enable to you to compare and contrast language/framework features.
* You should be independently reading, exploring, and experimenting with a range of frameworks throughout the module duration.
* You should be discussing the merits and features of a different frameworks with your peers and citing/references these discussions in code.
* You should be sharing your code and progress openly. This is good practice for all professional and personal projects.

## Referencing system
Your work must be adequately referenced throughout.
In program code; It is good practice to reference code patterns/snippets with url’s within code comments. 
This is useful for future maintainers to follow your thought process.
It is always important to acknowledge sources of information. It is acceptable to use snippets of other code if referenced and justified correctly.

## Learning Materials/Resources
* All learning materials and resources will be provided during the taught sessions and will be made available via
    * The module’s area on Blackboard
    * On GitHub in a public repository https://github.com/calaldees/frameworks_and_languages_module

## Reassessment information
Some students may be required to take reassessment for the module, following a decision from a Board of Examiner. 
Do check the Your Guide to Assessment and Award Processes and seek advice from your Personal Academic Tutor if this is the case for you. 
Support from the module team will be available in preparation for the reassessments.
