Programming Frameworks
======================

Level 6

Description
-----------

This course strengthen students' core technical ability of Web application system development.


Aims
----

1.	Build the knowledge and skills required for the development of a full stack web systems based on front-end and back-end separation, which lays a solid technical foundation for the development of enterprise-level web application systems.
2.	Students independently select technologies to solve a business problem based on a specification
3.	Though independent use of mainstream web frameworks, students build an understanding of the features of programming frameworks
4.	Use professionally relevant development tools and processes (version control, continuous integration, automated-tests, containers)



Learning Goals
--------------

1. Use a range of frameworks and languages in a range of different problem domains to solve a problem to a formal specification
2. Identify a range of framework/language features and describe the problems the technologies are trying to solve using technical language
3. Engage with professional industry developer tooling, including: containers, continuous integration and automated test frameworks


### Expanded

1. Understand that modern web applications are often split into multiple components (backend, frontend)
2. Independently select a variety frameworks solve a business problem/specification
3. Use a framework to create a RESTful API server that meets to an specification (e.g. OpenAPI spec)
4. Use a framework to create single page webapp client/frontend that uses a RESTful server
5. Use a visual layout framework to facilitate responsive design
6. Use automated test frameworks to test each component and integration test the overall application
7. Use version control and continuous integration to monitor ongoing development
8. Use containerisation to facilitate development and deployment of a multi component system (backend, frontend)
9. Use a variety of programming languages that are suited to different problem domains (backend, frontend)
10. Understand a variety of alternate patterns for web application development. Including: server-rendered, serverless, static site generation, unified server-client state systems (e.g. Distributed REActive Memoization)
11. Justify technology used using technical language (verbally and written)


Learning and Teaching Strategies
--------------------------------

* The module will be taught in a lab using mixed mode delivery as required, so that theory, practical and discussion can take place as required within one session
* Students will demonstrate progress in their assignment and will have the opportunity to gain feedback of their understanding in each session through the artefacts they are working on
* Automated tests (via industry CI tools) are to be used to give students feedback on their implementation progress


Indicative Assessment 
---------------------

| Name | Type | Module % | Word equivalent |
|-|-|-|-|
| Programming Project | Digital Artefact | 60% | 2400 |
| Framework Evaluation | Written Report | 40% | 1600 |


Additional/Extension/Optional links to other modules/domains
---------------------------------------------------

1. Use an appropriate persistent datastore
2. Deployment of containerised system
3. Integrate with a 3rd party service for authentication of web users

## Equipment you need to bring to class
* We will be using linux containers to develop and test software
* A cloud based IDE will be used to support your work both on and off campus
    * Cloud based development environments are becoming common practice for industry development. 
* Some students may wish to setup their own equipment for native development environment (e.g. DockerDesktop)

The majority of software engineering jobs require understanding and use of frameworks. Many software-engineering job are web technology focused as this is the current standard practice for interfacing and distributing content. Many of these jobs refer to frameworks such as React Native (client framework), Django (server framework), Full-Stack (client and server understanding) deploying to the cloud (containers), use of API’s (understanding how to build one, microservices). Many cite DevOps understanding (automated testing).

The module is highly aligned with practical employable skills.
I would posit that this is single handily the most industry relevant module in our offering.
