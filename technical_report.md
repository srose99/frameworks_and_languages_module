Notes on Framework-less Implementation
==========================

Server:
    How is routing handled?

    https://github.com/srose99/frameworks_and_languages_module/blob/ad2fa47971cd4f067b25f0d7134cd8db2a1b8c95/example_server/app/server.py#L9-L16

    https://github.com/srose99/frameworks_and_languages_module/blob/ad2fa47971cd4f067b25f0d7134cd8db2a1b8c95/example_server/app/web_utils.py#L15-L35

    Is it expandable? no, because of this implementation is can handle basic routing but any type of expansion leads to overriding. Also the routing is case/order sensitive so in future adding more routes will become difficult and time consuming

    Where are the CORS Headers set?

    https://github.com/srose99/frameworks_and_languages_module/blob/ad2fa47971cd4f067b25f0d7134cd8db2a1b8c95/example_server/app/web_utils.py#L48-L60

    Is this good/bad?

    It will work correctly if the function is called correctly. It is imported onto the http header but is'nt inherently called. Also accepts "*" as a default meaning any domain can access, extremely unsafe.

    The socket/network handling is very weak, why?

    No input validation for requests 

    What problem is Middleware trying to solve?

    Connectivity issues, it acts as the fabric mesh between applications and works to remove common issues developers may have regarding connectivity.
